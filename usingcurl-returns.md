# curl return codes

A lot of effort has gone into the project to make curl return a usable return
or exit code when something goes wrong and it will always return 0 (zero) when
the operation went as planned.

If you write a shell script or batch file that invokes curl, you can always
check the return code to detect problems in the invoked command. Below here,
you'll find a list of return codes as of the time of this writing. Over time
we tend to slowly add new ones so if you get a code back not listed here,
please refer to more updated curl documentation for aid.

A very basic unix shell script could look like something like this:

    #!/bin/sh
    curl http://example.com
    res=$?
    if test "$res" != "0"; then
       echo "the curl command failed with: $res"
    fi

## List of all exit codes

 1. Unsupported protocol. This build of curl has no support for this protocol.

 2. Failed to initialize.

 3. URL malformed. The syntax was not correct.

 4. A feature or option that was needed to perform the desired request was
    not enabled or was explicitly disabled at build-time. To make curl able
    to do this, you probably need another build of libcurl!

 5. Couldn't resolve proxy. The given proxy host could not be resolved.

 6. Couldn't resolve host. The given remote host was not resolved.

 7. Failed to connect to host.

 8. Unknown FTP server response. The server sent data curl couldn't parse.

 9. FTP access denied. The server denied login or denied access to the
    particular resource or directory you wanted to reach. Most often you
    tried to change to a directory that doesn't exist on the server.

 10. **Not used**

 11. FTP weird PASS reply. Curl couldn't parse the reply sent to the PASS
    request.

 12. **Not used**

 13. Unknown response to FTP PASV command, Curl couldn't parse the reply
    sent to the PASV request.

 14. Unknown FTP 227 format. Curl couldn't parse the 227-line the server
    sent.
 
 15.  FTP can't get host. Couldn't resolve the host IP we got in the
    227-line.

 16. **Not used**

 17. FTP couldn't set binary. Couldn't change transfer method to binary.

 18. Partial file. Only a part of the file was transferred.

 19. FTP couldn't download/access the given file, the RETR (or similar)
    command failed.

 20. **Not used**

 21. FTP quote error. A quote command returned error from the server.

 22. HTTP page not retrieved. The requested url was not found or returned
     another error with the HTTP error code being 400 or above. This return
     code only appears if -f, --fail is used.

 23. Write error. Curl couldn't write data to a local filesystem or similar.

 24. **Not used**

 25. The FTP server refused to store the file. The server denied the STOR
     operation, used for FTP uploading.

 28. Operation timeout. The specified time-out period was reached according to the
     conditions.

 29. **Not used**

 30. FTP PORT failed. The PORT command failed. Not all FTP servers support
     the PORT command, try doing a transfer using PASV instead!

     for resumed FTP transfers.

 32. **Not used**

 33. HTTP range error. The range request didn't work.
